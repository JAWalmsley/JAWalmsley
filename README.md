# Hi there, I'm Jack
ðŸ“š I'm a software engineering student at McMaster University.

ðŸ”¨ I've made projects with a lot of different technologies over the years and I'm still learning more with every project I make.

âœ… I've created a website for managing courses and assignment due dates called [DueTomorrow](https://duetomorrow.ca). Its source code can be found [here](https://github.com/JAWalmsley/DueTomorrow).

ðŸ§  Recently I've been exploring evolutionary machine learning writing [NEATJS](https://github.com/JAWalmsley/NEATJS), an implementation of NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies in Javascript.
